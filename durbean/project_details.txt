Django Task:

Develop a Django Rest Framework (DRF) project to create API views that allow users to register, login, and logout using JWT Token authentication. The project should include endpoints for obtaining and refreshing tokens. The tokens should have a short lifespan, expiring every 5 minutes.
To create the user model, you should utilize Django's AbstractUser to extend the default User model. Additionally, implement a custom model manager for the user model.
